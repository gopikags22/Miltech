MilTech Ops Simulation: An AI-driven military operations simulation platform that integrates real time target detection, tactical communication tools, semaphore decoding, and multilingual translation designed to showcase intelligent defence tech systems.
MilTech Ops Simulation is an interactive platform that brings multiple defence-oriented technologies into one system.
It acts as a virtual military assistant, capable of:
Detecting targets using AI
Decoding military communication formats
Translating languages in real-time
Assisting trainees with tactical decision-making
This project is built using Python (backend) and the Flask framework.
 1. AI Target Detection
Identifies potential objects or threats using basic AI logic
Simulates battlefield awareness
Accepts user inputs or mock image recognition data
 2. Military Communication Suite
Includes:
Morse Code Encoder / Decoder
NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter
Semaphore Signal Decoder
(for training, communication, and simulation purposes)
3. Real-time Language Translation
Converts sentences between languages
Useful for cross-border coordination and intelligence interpretation
4. Simple & Modular Architecture
Easy integration of new AI modules
Clean API-style backend structure
Suitable for academic or prototype-level defence tech systems
Tech Stack
Backend - Python Flask
Frontend
HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Responsive UI components
